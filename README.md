# Welcome the Shadowbunny 
## Leveraging virtual machines (VMs) during lateral movement

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**PLEASE VISIT AGAIN SOON FOR CODE EXAMPLES AND MORE DETAILS**

**********************************************************

The latest edition of the [PenTest Magazine](https://pentestmag.com/product/pentest-healthcare-security/) features an article of mine about using virtual machines (VMs) during lateral movement to establish persistence and evade detections.

A few years back when I came up with the idea of using VMs for lateral movement during red teaming, I called it the **Shadowbunny TTP** and that name stuck around in my head. There is more info in the article around the origin of the name also.

Real world adversaries have been using VMs as well, including the [Ragnar Locker Ransomware](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/21/ragnar-locker-ransomware-deploys-virtual-machine-to-dodge-security/), and it's time to shine more light on this, so that we have better chances of detecting such attacks.

### Future information about the Shadowbunny technique

This repo will soon contain more details about creation, installation, configuration, and pivoting steps for a custom Shadowbunny VM using VirtualBox and Hyper-V. As well as details and ideas for detections.
And this repo will contain more information about the technical details soon.

Stay tuned!
